                                innovation and mass scale. It is the world's largest online marketplace, AI
                                assistant provider, live-streaming platform and cloud computing platform as measured
                                by revenue and market capitalization. Amazon is the largest Internet company by
                                revenue in the world. It is the second largest private employer in the United
                                States and one of the world's most valuable companies. As of 2020, Amazon has the

                                Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the
                                son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Theodore Jørgensen. His biological great-grandfather
                                John Jørgensen, born 8 January 1872 on the small island of Samsø, then in Holbæk County,
                                Zealand, today a municipality in the Central Denmark Region, Denmark, immigrated around
                                1900 to Chicago, where he had a son, Theodore "Ted" John Jorgensen (b. 1917) with his
                                wife, Ida Minnie Jorgensen, who was also born in Denmark. This son was the father of Ted
                                Jorgensen (b. 1944), Jeff Bezo's biological father. At the
                                time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was
                                19.[17] After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended
                                night school while bringing baby Jeff along. After his parents divorced, his mother
                                married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after the
                                wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to
                                Bezos. The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for
                                Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico. Bezos attended
                                River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade. Bezos's maternal
                                grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy
                                Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque. Gise retired early to his family's ranch near
                                Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth. Bezos would later
                                purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres
                                (121,406 ha). His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (née Strait),
                                through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.

                                Bezos displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and once rigged an
                                electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room. The family moved to
                                Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School. While Bezos was
                                in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast
                                shift. He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of
                                Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar, and a
                                Silver Knight Award winner in 1982. In his graduation speech, Bezos told the
                                audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper
                                quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge
                                national park". In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with
                                a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical
                                engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa. While
                                at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating
                                clubs. In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the
                                Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space
                                (SEDS).
