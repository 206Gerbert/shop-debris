                                Zennström started his professional career in 1991 at the European telecom operator
                                Tele2. He
                                went on to serve in various business development roles including launching and being
                                responsible for European Internet Service Provider business get2net and as CEO of the
                                everyday.com portal.

                                In 2000, Zennström and Janus Friis co-founded Kazaa, the peer-to-peer file sharing
                                application. Niklas served as CEO and the program became the world's most downloaded
                                Internet software in 2003. After lawsuits were filed by members of the music and motion
                                picture industry in the US, Kazaa was sold to Sharman Networks.

                                Zennström then founded and served as CEO at Joltid, a software company developing and
                                marketing peer-to-peer solutions and traffic optimization technologies. Zennström also
                                co-founded Altnet, the world's first secure peer-to-peer network promoting commercial
                                content to consumers integrating promotion, distribution, and payment of digital
                                content.

                                Zennström's most notable success to date is Skype, a telephony company based on
                                peer-to-peer
                                principles. In October 2005, Skype was acquired by eBay for €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion)
                                plus
                                the potential to earn further performance-based bonuses up to €1.2bn. Zennström was CEO
                                from
                                Skype's inception until September 2007. During that time, Skype became the global leader
                                in
                                Internet voice communications with more than 309 million registered users within five
                                years
                                of launch. After the sale of Skype, Zennström went on in 2007 to launch Joost, an online
                                video distribution service (where Zennström was co-chairman).

                                Zennström started his professional career in 1991 at the European telecom operator
                                Tele2. He
                                went on to serve in various business development roles including launching and being
                                responsible for European Internet Service Provider business get2net and as CEO of the
                                everyday.com portal.

                                In 2000, Zennström and Janus Friis co-founded Kazaa, the peer-to-peer file sharing
                                application. Niklas served as CEO and the program became the world's most downloaded
                                Internet software in 2003. After lawsuits were filed by members of the music and motion
                                picture industry in the US, Kazaa was sold to Sharman Networks.

                                Zennström then founded and served as CEO at Joltid, a software company developing and
                                marketing peer-to-peer solutions and traffic optimization technologies. Zennström also
                                co-founded Altnet, the world's first secure peer-to-peer network promoting commercial
                                content to consumers integrating promotion, distribution, and payment of digital
                                content.

                                Zennström's most notable success to date is Skype, a telephony company based on
                                peer-to-peer
                                principles. In October 2005, Skype was acquired by eBay for €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion)
                                plus
                                the potential to earn further performance-based bonuses up to €1.2bn. Zennström was CEO
                                from
                                Skype's inception until September 2007. During that time, Skype became the global leader
                                in
                                Internet voice communications with more than 309 million registered users within five
                                years
                                of launch. After the sale of Skype, Zennström went on in 2007 to launch Joost, an online
                                video distribution service (where Zennström was co-chairman).
