                                Zennström started his professional career in 1991 at the European telecom operator
                                Tele2. He went on to serve in various business development roles including launching and
                                being responsible for European Internet Service Provider business get2net and as CEO of
                                the everyday.com portal.

                                In 2000, Zennström and Janus Friis co-founded Kazaa, the peer-to-peer file sharing
                                application. Niklas served as CEO and the program became the world's most downloaded
                                Internet software in 2003. After lawsuits were filed by members of the music and motion
                                picture industry in the US, Kazaa was sold to Sharman Networks.

                                Zennström then founded and served as CEO at Joltid, a software company developing and
                                marketing peer-to-peer solutions and traffic optimization technologies. Zennström also
                                co-founded Altnet, the world's first secure peer-to-peer network promoting commercial
                                content to consumers integrating promotion, distribution, and payment of digital

                                Zennström's most notable success to date is Skype, a telephony company based on
                                peer-to-peer principles. In October 2005, Skype was acquired by eBay for €2.1 billion
                                ($2.6 billion) plus
                                the potential to earn further performance-based bonuses up to €1.2bn. Zennström was CEO
                                from
                                Skype's inception until September 2007. During that time, Skype became the global leader
                                in
                                Internet voice communications with more than 309 million registered users within five
                                years
                                of launch. After the sale of Skype, Zennström went on in 2007 to launch Joost, an online
                                video distribution service (where Zennström was co-chairman).

                                Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström, from Sweden, and Janus Friis, from
                                Denmark. The Skype software was created by Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu,
                                Jaan Tallinn, and Toivo Annus. Friis and Annus are credited with the idea of
                                reducing the cost of voice calls by using a P2P protocol like that of Kazaa. An
                                early alpha version was created and tested in spring 2003, and the first public beta
                                version was released on 29 August 2003.

                                In June 2005, Skype entered an agreement with the Polish web portal Onet.pl for an
                                integrated offering on the Polish market. On 12 September 2005, eBay Inc. agreed to
                                acquire Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies SA for approximately US$2.5 billion in
                                up-front cash and eBay stock, plus potential performance-based consideration. On 1
                                September 2009, eBay announced it was selling 65% of Skype to Silver Lake, Andreessen
                                Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for US$1.9 billion, valuing Skype
                                at US$2.75 billion. On 14 July 2011, Skype partnered with Comcast to bring its video
                                chat service to Comcast subscribers via HDTV sets.

                                On 17 June 2013, Skype released a free video messaging service, which can be operated on
                                Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and BlackBerry.

                                Between 2017 and 2020, Skype collaborated with PayPal to provide a money-send feature.
                                It allowed users to transfer funds via the Skype mobile app in the middle of a
                                conversation.

                                In 2019, Skype was announced to be the sixth most downloaded mobile app of the decade,
                                from 2010 to 2019.

                                On 10 May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications, S.à r.l for US$8.5
                                billion. The company was incorporated as a division of Microsoft, which acquired all
                                its technologies with the purchase. The acquisition was completed on 13 October
                                2011. Shortly after the acquisition, Microsoft began integrating the Skype
                                service with its own products. Along with taking over the development of existing Skype
                                desktop and mobile apps, the company developed a dedicated client app for its then-newly
                                released, touch-focused Windows 8 and Windows RT operating systems. They were made
                                available from Windows Store when the then-new OS launched on 26 October 2012. The
                                following year, it became the default messaging app for Windows 8.1, replacing the
                                Windows 8 Messaging app at the time, and became pre-installed software on every device
                                that came with or upgraded to 8.1.

                                <br>
                                In a month-long transition period from 8 to 30 April 2013, Microsoft discontinued
                                two[see talk] of its own products in favor of Skype, one being its long-standing Windows
                                Live Messenger instant messaging service, although Messenger continued to be available
                                in mainland China.

                                On 11 November 2014, Microsoft announced that in 2015, Lync would be replaced by Skype
                                for Business. The latest version of the communication software combines features of Lync
                                and consumer Skype software. There are two user interfaces—organizations can switch
                                their users from the default Skype for Business interface to the Lync interface.
